# AI Prompts Collection

> **Русская версия:** [README_RUS.md](README_RUS.md) | **繁體中文版本：** [README_ZH.md](README_ZH.md)

A comprehensive collection of professionally crafted AI prompts for various applications, from coding assistance to content processing. This repository contains structured, production-ready prompts designed for modern AI systems.

## 🎯 Ultimate Prompt Architect (UPA) Framework

**Nearly all prompts in this collection were created using the Ultimate Prompt Architect framework** - our flagship system for systematic, high-quality prompt engineering:

- **Mandatory Clarification Loop** - Up to 5 rounds of requirement gathering to ensure precision
- **Deep Reasoning Protocol** - 4-step systematic prompt construction with transparent logic
- **Positive Reframing Rules** - Convert negative constraints to positive directives for better AI behavior
- **Self-Critique System** - Built-in quality assurance and verification loops
- **Structured Output** - Complete documentation with metadata and optimized parameters

The UPA framework ensures every prompt is robust, well-documented, and follows best practices for AI interaction. It represents months of refinement in prompt engineering methodology.

```yaml
# Highly recommended UPA parameters
temperature: 0.2          # Deterministic, consistent design
reasoning_effort: "high"  # Multi-step planning and analysis
verbosity: "high"         # Detailed reasoning and outputs
```

**🧠 Model Requirements:** UPA requires advanced reasoning capabilities and should only be used with the most sophisticated AI models:
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (Google)
- **DeepSeek R1** or **v3+** (DeepSeek)
- **GPT-5** (OpenAI)
- **Claude Opus 4** (Anthropic)
- Other frontier models with comparable reasoning abilities

### 🔧 How to Use UPA for Creating New Prompts

1. **Load the UPA Framework**
   - Copy the complete UPA prompt from **[UPA.md](UPA.md)** (in repository root)
   - Set the recommended parameters above in your AI system

2. **Start with Your Request**
   - Simply describe what kind of prompt you need
   - Be as specific or general as you want - UPA will clarify everything

3. **Engage in Clarification Loop**
   - Answer UPA's questions (up to 5 rounds)
   - Provide details about your use case, constraints, and goals
   - Don't worry about being perfect - UPA will guide you

4. **Let UPA Work Through the Process**
   - **Stage 1:** Planning and hypothesis generation
   - **Stage 2:** Step-by-step prompt construction
   - **Stage 3:** Self-critique and verification
   - **Stage 4:** Final documented prompt with metadata

5. **Get Your Complete Prompt**
   - Receive a fully documented prompt with:
     - Title and suggested filename
     - Description and key features
     - Optimized parameters
     - Complete, production-ready prompt text

**Example starter request:**
> "Create a prompt for a code review assistant that helps senior developers identify security vulnerabilities and performance issues in Python code."

The UPA will then guide you through creating a robust, professional prompt following all best practices.
