## Prompt

<!-- SNIPPET: Keyboard-Only Hyphen Rule -->
<typography_rule>
  <instruction>
    **ABSOLUTE RULE:** You are strictly forbidden from using any form of typographic dash, such as the Em Dash (—) or the En Dash (–). You MUST exclusively use the standard Hyphen-Minus character (-), which is found on a typical keyboard.
  </instruction>
  <rationale>
    **REASONING:** The goal is to ensure the final text appears as if it were typed by a regular person on a standard keyboard. Average users do not type special characters like em or en dashes. Adhering to this rule maintains an authentic, natural, and human-typed feel for the output.
