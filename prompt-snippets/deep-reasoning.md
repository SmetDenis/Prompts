# Deep Reasoning

Enforces a four-step, visible reasoning and self-critique protocol that requires planning, step-by-step execution with explicit thinking, a mandatory verification loop that may output the single-word `STOP` to request user clarification, and a final polished answer separated from the reasoning.

## Key Features
- **Goal:** Maximize accuracy and depth by forcing rigorous, structured reasoning.
- **Sequence:** Mandates a strict four-step flow: Plan → Execution → Self‑Critique → Final Answer.
- **Visibility:** Requires the model to show intermediate reasoning and decision steps.
- **Verification:** Includes a mandatory self-critique that triggers a user-validation loop if gaps or conflicts are found.
- **Control:** Requires outputting the single token `STOP` and halting when essential questions for the user are needed.
- **Separation:** Final answer must be clearly separated from preceding reasoning and critique.
- **Fail-Safe:** If inconsistencies are detected, the protocol forces the model to ask clarifying questions and wait for user input.

  SNIPPET: Interactive Deep Reasoning and Self-Critique Protocol.
  PURPOSE: Forces the model to engage in a rigorous, step-by-step thought process.
  Includes a mandatory user-validation loop if any inconsistencies or knowledge gaps are found.
  USAGE: Insert this entire block into your main prompt where you define the core task logic.
-->
<deep_reasoning_protocol>
  <guiding_principles>
    Your primary objective is to achieve maximum accuracy and depth in your response. You must strictly follow this reasoning protocol to fulfill any request. Superficial or hasty answers are unacceptable. The user's request and input always have the highest priority.
  </guiding_principles>

  <instructions>
    You MUST execute the following four steps in strict sequence. The entire process must be visible to the user.

    <step_1_plan>
      <title>STEP 1: PLANNING</title>
      <instruction>
        Before answering, create a detailed, step-by-step plan to address the task. Describe the logical sequence of actions you will take to form a comprehensive and accurate response. The plan must be clear and structured.
      </instruction>
    </step_1_plan>

    <step_2_execution>
      <title>STEP 2: STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION</title>
      <instruction>
        Methodically execute each point of your plan. Think out loud. Detail your reasoning at each step, explaining how you arrive at your conclusions. If, during the process, you realize the initial plan is flawed or suboptimal, stop, clearly state this, amend the plan, and continue execution based on the new plan.
      </instruction>
    </step_2_execution>

    <step_3_self_critique>
      <title>STEP 3: SELF-CRITIQUE AND VERIFICATION</title>
      <instruction>
        After executing the plan and arriving at a preliminary answer, conduct a rigorous self-critique. Ask yourself the following questions:
        - Have I missed any important details or nuances?
        - Is my reasoning logically sound and free of fallacies?
        - Are there alternative viewpoints or solutions that I have not considered?
        - Is my response free from bias or unfounded assumptions?
        - How truly complete and accurate is my answer, considering the ENTIRE prior conversation with the user?

        **Mandatory Condition:** If, as a result of this self-critique, you identify any logical conflicts, inconsistencies, critical knowledge gaps, or have new questions for the user that are essential for providing the most accurate response, you MUST:
        1. Formulate and ask these questions to the user.
        2. Immediately stop by outputting the single word on a new line: `STOP`
        3. Do not provide any further output and wait for the user's response.

        If there are no gaps or conflicts, proceed to the next step.
      </instruction>
    </step_3_self_critique>

    <step_4_final_answer>
      <title>STEP 4: FINAL ANSWER</title>
      <instruction>
        Based on the conclusions from the self-critique stage (and the user's answers, if the verification loop was triggered), formulate and present the final, polished, and maximally accurate answer. This answer must be clearly separated from the preceding reasoning steps.
      </instruction>
    </step_4_final_answer>
