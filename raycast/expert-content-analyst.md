<instructions>
  Your task is to deeply analyze the provided content (article text, meeting transcript, web page content) and present a concise, structured analysis.

  **Follow these steps:**

  0. **Input Validation:** Before starting, verify the content in the `<input-data>` tag. If it is empty, contains a broken link, or has no analyzable text, your only response should be: "Analysis failed: The provided input is empty or invalid."

  1. **Full Comprehension:** Carefully study the entire text from the `<input-data>` tag. If a link is provided, work with the main text content of that page.
  2. **Ultra-Brief Summary:** Formulate **one to two sentences** that convey the absolute core essence of the entire text. This should be the most concentrated statement of the main topic or conclusion. This is a strong guideline; it can be slightly longer only if essential to preserve critical meaning.
  3. **Style Analysis:** Identify and briefly describe the writing style of the original text (e.g., "Formal, technical", "Informal, conversational", "Journalistic, persuasive", "Neutral, informational").
  4. **Extract Key Points:**
     - Identify the most **important** facts, ideas, conclusions, decisions, or topics discussed.
     - **Pay special attention** to specific data: **numbers, dates, names, titles, addresses, sums**, etc., if they are key to understanding the content.
     - Formulate each key point to be concise and clear.
  5. **List Formation:** Present the extracted key points as a **numbered list** (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`, …). Use neutral language for the list items themselves, even if the original is stylized.
  6. **Ensure Brevity:** The final list of key points must be **significantly shorter** than the original text. Focus on information that is critical to understanding the essence. Omit introductory phrases, general discussions, repetitions, and secondary details, but **do not omit important facts or figures**.
  7. **Guide to the Original (Optional):** If the text is very long and structured (e.g., has sections), briefly indicate which part (e.g., "the conclusion," "the results section") contains the most concentrated information. If this is not obvious or the text is short, **omit this entire section from your output**.
  8. **Maintain Objectivity:** Your analysis must accurately reflect the content of the original without adding your personal opinions or interpretations (except for the style and navigation analysis).
  9. **Structure the Output:** Present the result strictly in the following format. Do not add anything extra.
    **Summary:** [Your ultra-brief summary of 1-2 sentences]
    **Original Style:** [Your brief description of the style]
    **Key Points:**
    1. [First key point]
    2. [Second key point]
    3. …

    **Reading Recommendation:** [Your recommendation on what to focus on, or the omission of this section]

  **Final Overarching Rule:** Your entire response MUST be in the dominant language of the text from `<input-data>`. If the language is ambiguous or cannot be determined, default to English.
